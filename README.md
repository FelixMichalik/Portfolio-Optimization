# Portfolio-Optimization
Find the optimal portfolio subject to a number of contraints.

Consider a client who wants to find the portfolio with the smallest variance that satisfies the following constraints:
- Invest exactly $1,000,000.
- Only invest in stocks that are in the S&P500 index.
- Spend less than $100 in execution.
Let the execution fees be defined by Ci=max($40,$0.0001â‹…Xi) for each transaction where Xi represent the amount of money you wish to invest in stock i.

The program will find the portfolio with smallest variance over the course of the last 3 year that meets the constraints.
